Script Name: Azure AI Vision Image Analysis and Background Processing

Description:
This Python script integrates with Azure AI Vision services to perform comprehensive image analysis and background processing tasks. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

Key Features:
Image Analysis:

Visual Features Extraction: The script identifies and extracts:
Captions: Generates a descriptive summary of the image content with confidence scores.
Dense Captions: Provides detailed descriptions for various regions within the image.
Tags: Assigns relevant tags to the image with associated confidence scores.
Objects: Detects and identifies objects in the image, including their bounding boxes.
People: Detects individuals in the image, highlighting their bounding boxes.
Output:
Annotated images (objects.jpg and people.jpg): Includes bounding boxes for detected objects and people.
Background Removal:

Leverages the Azure AI Vision segmentation API to remove the background or generate a foreground matte.
Output:
Background-removed image (background.png).
Input:
An image file specified via the command line.
Outputs:
objects.jpg: Image with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects.
people.jpg: Image with bounding boxes highlighting detected individuals.
background.png: Image with the background removed.
Additional Information:
Configuration: Uses environment variables (AI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT and AI_SERVICE_KEY) for Azure credentials.
Error Handling: Provides detailed error messages for HTTP response errors.
This script simplifies image analysis by automating tasks such as object detection, dense captioning, and background removal, providing actionable insights and processed visuals.
